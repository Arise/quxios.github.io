## AboutA collider based action battle system for QMovement. *Note* This is notyour simple rpg maker action battle system. Using this plugin you cancreate more advance like action games.For a demo visit the steamwork shop or Github repo- http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=952886994- https://github.com/quxios/QMV-ABS-Demo**_Plugin files in the repo are always kept up to date_**

## Is this for you?First, this is a very complex action battle system. If you're looking forsomething that you can spend less than an hour to set up then this pluginis not for you.To make full use of this plugin you need to know how to properly use andsetup QMovement. If you don't know what that plugin is or what collidersare then again, this plugin is not for you.There are a lot of actions for skill sequences so you can create some prettycrazy skills. Learning how to use the actions may take awhile since thereare a lot of actions, and maybe more to come.Enemies have a very basic AI. If you want to create more AI styles, youwill need to know how to JS and create a plugin / extend this plugin.

## Skill Keys
### **Default Skill keys**For the player to be able to use a skill from a hotkey, you will first needto create a skill key in the plugin parameter `Default Skills`.![Skill Keys](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qabs/skillKeys.png)When creating a skill key you have 4 parameters:- #### Keyboard Input: * The keyboard input that will trigger this skill, set this to `mouse1` for   left click, and `mouse2` for right click.- #### Gamepad Input: * The gamepad input that will trigger this skill.- #### Rebind: * If this is true, the skill that's assigned to this skill key can be reassigned.- #### Skill Id: * The skill that this skill key will use when triggered.**_Note_** for input values those are the button values; `ok`, `cancel`, ect. Orif you're using an input plugin, use their value. For example in QInput you canuse the `#A` for the a key or `#tab` for tab, ect.**_Note_** that rebind doesn't do much as this doesn't have a rebinding feature.But the ground work is there so it can easily be created for an addon.**_Note_** that the `Skill Key Number` is the number next to the skill key you created.`Skill Key Number` will be referenced later.![Skill Keys](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qabs/skillKeysNumber.png)

### **Class Skill keys**You can change the players skill keys based on their class by adding the notetag:~~~<skillKeys>[SKILL KEY NUMBER]: [SKILL ID] [REBIND?]</skillKeys>~~~- #### SKILL KEY NUMBER: * The skill key that you want to change- #### SKILL ID: * The skill to assign to this skill key number- #### REBIND?: * Set to true or false if this can be reassignedIf the skill key that you are trying to change has its `Rebind` value set to false,nothing will happen since it can't be reassigned.**_Important!_** make sure the skill key you are trying to set is created in theplugin parameters `Default Skills`. If it's not, the game will have an error.Example:~~~<skillKeys>1: 23: 154: 16</skillKeys>~~~Class Skill keys will replace the default skill keys. So if you set up skillkeys 1 through 9 in the parameters and a class changes the skills for skillkeys 1, 3, 4. The over all skill keys will be, 1, 3, 4 from the class andthe rest are from the default values.

### **Weapon Skill keys**Weapons can also change the skill keys. For example you might want to changethe main attack to use a range skill if the player has a bow equipped! To dothis you use a similar tag as the class, but in the weapon~~~<skillKeys>[SKILL KEY NUMBER]: [SKILL ID]</skillKeys>~~~- #### SKILL KEY NUMBER: * The skill key that you want to change- #### SKILL ID: * The skill to assign to this skill key number**_Important!_** make sure the skill key you are trying to set is created in theplugin parameters `Default Skills`. If it's not, the game will have an error.Example:~~~<skillKeys>1: 3</skillKeys>~~~Weapon skill keys take top priority, so they will replace both class keysand the default keys! This example will replace skill key 1 with the skillid 3

### **Override Skill keys**You can manually override a skill key with a plugin command. Override skill keystake priority over weapon, class and default skill keys.Plugin command:~~~qabs override SKILLKEYNUMBER SKILLID~~~- #### SKILLKEYNUMBER: * The skill key that you want to change- #### SKILLID: * The skill to assign to this skill key number. Set to -1 if you want to   remove this override**_Important!_** make sure the skill key you are trying to set is created in theplugin parameters `Default Skills`. If it's not, the game will have an error.**_Note_** that the player still needs to know the skill to be able to use it.Assigning it won't let him use it if he doesn't know it.Example:~~~qabs override 1 3~~~Will override skill key 1 and assign the skill with id 3. To remove thisoverride later on use the plugin command:~~~qabs override 1 -1~~~

## Skills
### **Skill Settings**Each skill should have a skill settings tag. This tag can change the settingsfor the skills cooldown, through, and other effects. The tag is:~~~ <absSettings> [SETTINGS]: [VALUE] </absSettings>~~~Here's a list of all the settings:~~~collider: [SHAPE], [WIDTH], [HEIGHT]collides: [STRING]cooldown: [NUMBER]infront: [TRUE or FALSE]rotate: [TRUE or FALSE]through: [0, 1, 2 or 3]throughTerrain: [LIST OF TERRAINS IT CAN GO THROUGH]groundtarget: [NUMBER]selecttarget: [NUMBER]~~~- #### collider: * Set this to the collider this skill will use. See QMovement help for details   on colliders.  * Default: The users collider * Format is: `shape, width, height`- #### collides:  * Set this to which collider type to check for against skill hit. If you want to use a custom collider, use the `<colliders></colliders>` tag * Default: collision- #### cooldown: * Set to the number of frames until you can use this skill again.  * Default: 0- #### infront: * Set to true or false. When true, the collider will appear in front of the user.   When false the collider will be centered on the user.  * Default: false- #### rotate: * Set to true or false.

If value is 0 select    targeting will not be used.  * Default: 0

### **Skill Sequence**When a skill is used, it's sequence will run. You will need to configurea sequence to tell the skill what it should do or it won't do anything.This can be done with the notetag:~~~ <absSequence> [ACTION] </absSequence>~~~There are a bunch of actions. Each action needs to be on a different line.Here's a list of all the actions:~~~user casting [TRUE or FALSE]user lockuser unlockuser speed [INC or DEC] [VALUE]user move [FORWARD or BACKWARD] [DIST] [WAIT?

## Disabling QABSYou can disable the QABS or disable certain events with a plugin command.#### To disable the QABS for everything use the plugin command~~~qabs disable~~~#### To re-enable use the plugin command:~~~qabs enable~~~#### To disable certain event(s) use the plugin command~~~qabs disable [LIST OF CHARAIDS TO DISABLE]~~~- CHARAID: The character identifier. * For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID, eventEVENTID or this for the event that   called this (replace EVENTID with a number)Where each CHARAID is separated with a space. CHARAID can only be for events.#### Example:~~~qabs disable event1 e2 4~~~Will disable events 1, 2 and 4. Used different types of CHARAIDs as an examplebut you can use whichever one you like#### To re-enable event(s) use the plugin command~~~qabs enable [LIST OF CHARAIDS TO DISABLE]~~~**_Note_** that disabling ABS doesn't remove it from the event, it just "pauses"it until it's re-enabled.

## StatesTo have a state affect the characters move speed use:~~~<moveSpeed:X>~~~Set X to the value to modify the move speed by. Can be negative.To disable a characters actions, use the following notetag. When disabledthe character can't use any skills until the state is removed.~~~<stun>~~~

## PopupsAll of the popups are powered with the QPopup plugin. If you want to changeany styles of the popups you can edit their presets in that plugins parametersor using the plugin commands from the QPopup plugin.The following are the qPopup presets this ABS uses:- QABS-LEVEL- QABS-EXP- QABS-ITEM- QABS-MISSED- QABS-DMG- QABS-DMG-CRIT- QABS-HEAL- QABS-HEAL-CRIT- QABS-MP- QABS-MP-CRIT
