## AboutThis plugin adds an input remapping window to the Scene_Options. This letsplayers change their keybinds ingame.

## How to usePlace this anywhere below QInput plugin. Input configs are saved into the`saves/config.rpgsave` file

## TipTo make best use of this, in your QInput parameters, each action should onlyhave 2 keys. One for the keyboard input and 1 for the gamepad input. This pluginonly remaps the first input. So for example:Lets say you had `enter` action as:~~~#space, #e, $A~~~When the player goes to remap the enter key, they'll see either Space or A,depending on which input they are currenting using. So they will never be ableto remap the #e key. Now in some cases this may be fine. But just know thatthe only the 1st instance of the input type is remappable!
