## AboutThis adds support for followers when using QMovement.*Note:* I won't be continuing working on this plugin. I personally dislikefollowers and rather not do anything with them. So if you have issues with thisplugin you will need to try to fix it your self or find another plugin devto fix it for you. Sorry!
