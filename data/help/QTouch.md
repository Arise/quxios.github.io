## About
This plugin extands the mouse features of MV to make it feel more natural.
You are able to change the image used for the cursor. Cursor will change
to pointing cursor when hovering over a selectable item. You can make
the cursor hide when it's inactive for X frames. Window choices will
get selected / highlighted when the mouse is over them. And clicking on
them once will run that choice.


## How to use
Just install this plugin and configure the plugin parameters.

The filepath is from the base directory. So if your cursor is in the system
folder your path should be something like:
~~~
 img/system/myCursor.png
~~~


## Plugin commands
To change the cursors image:
~~~
 qTouch change TYPE FILE
~~~
- TYPE: Set to 'default' or 'pointer'
- FILE: The file path to the cursor from the base directory
