## AboutThis plugin will zoom in/out character sprites based on their y positionon the map.

## How to use
### **Map Notetag**To make a map have a YScale, you need to give it a note tag in the format:~~~ <scale:MIN,MAX>~~~- Min: The zoom value at the top of the map (0 Y position)- Max: The zoom value at the bottom of the map

## Notetags / Comments
### **Have an event ignore YScale**Adding the following to the notes or in a comment will make that event ignoreYScaling.~~~ <noYScale>~~~When its in the notes, it applies to all pages. When its in the commentsit applies only to that page.
