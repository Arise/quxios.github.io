    "about": "\n## About\r\rThis plugin completely rewrites the collision system to use colliders. Using\rcolliders enabled more accurate collision checking with dealing with pixel\rmovement. This plugin also lets you change how many pixels the characters\rmove per step, letting you set up a 24x24 movement or a 1x1 (pixel movement)\r\rNote there are a few mv features disabled/broken; mouse movement, followers,\rand vehicles.\r",
    "help": "\n## How to use\r\rTo setup a pixel based movement, you'll need to change the plugin parameters\rto something like:\r\r- Grid = 1\r- Off Grid = true\r- Mid Pass = false\r\rOther parameters can be set to your preference.\r\rFor a grid based movement, set it something like:\r\r- Grid = GRIDSIZE YOU WANT\r- Off Grid = false\r- Mid Pass = true\r\rWhen in grid based movement, you want your colliders to fill up most of the\rgrid size but with a padding of 4 pixels on all sides (this is because some\rtile colliders are 4 tiles wide or tall). So if your grid size was 48, your\rcolliders shouldn't be 48x48, instead they should be 40x40, with an ox and oy\rof 4. So your collider setting would look like: box, 40, 40, 4, 4\r\n\n## Colliders\r\rThere are 3 types of colliders; Polygon, Box and Circle. Though you can only\rcreate box and circle colliders, unless you modify the code to accept\rpolygons. This is intentional since polygon would be \"harder\" to setup.\r\r![Colliders Image](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qmovement/colliders.png)\r\r- Boxes takes in width, height, offset x and offset y\r- Circles similar to boxes, takes in width, height, offset x and offset y\r\r### Setting up colliders\r\rColliders are setup inside the Players notebox or as a comment inside an\rEvents page. Events colliders depends it's page, so you may need to make the\rcollider on all pages.\r\rThere are two ways to setup colliders. using `<collider:-,-,-,->` and using\r`<colliders>-</colliders>`. The first method sets the 'Default' collider for\rthat character. The second one you create the colliders for every collider\rtype.\r\r### Collider Types\r\rThere are 3 collider types. Default, Collision and Interaction.\r- Default: This is the collider to use if collider type that was called was\rnot found\r- Collision: This collider is used for collision checking\r- Interaction: This collider is used for checking interaction.\r\n\n## Collider Terms\r\r![Colliders Terms Image](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qmovement/colliderInfo.png)\r\r### Collider Notetag\r\r~~~\r <collider: shape, width, height, ox, oy>\r~~~\rThis notetag sets all collider types to these values.\r- Shape: Set to box or circle\r- Width: The width of the collider\r- Height: The height of the collider\r- OX: The x offset value of the collider\r- OY: The y offset value of the collider\r\r### Colliders Notetag\r\r~~~\r <colliders>\r type: shape, width, height, ox, oy\r </colliders>\r~~~\rThis notetag sets all collider types to these values.\r- Type: The type of collider, set to default, collision or interaction\r- Shape: Set to box or circle\r- Width: The width of the collider\r- Height: The height of the collider\r- OX: The x offset value of the collider\r- OY: The y offset value of the collider\r\rTo add another type, just add `type: shape, width, height, ox, oy` on\ranother line.\r\rExample:\r~~~\r <colliders>\r default: box, 48, 48\r collision: circle, 24, 24, 12, 12\r interaction: box: 32, 32, 8, 8\r </colliders>\r~~~\r\n\n## Move Routes\r\rBy default, event move commands (moveup, movedown, ect) will convert to a\rqmove that moves the character based off your tilesize. So if your tilesize\ris 48 and your gridsize is 1. Then a moveup command will move the character\rup 48 pixels not 1. But if you want to move the character by a fixed amount\rof pixels, then you will use the QMove commands.\r\r### QMove\r\r![QMove Script Call](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qmovement/qmove.png)\r\rTo do a QMove, add a script in the move route in the format:\r~~~\r qmove(DIR, AMOUNT, MULTIPLER)\r~~~\r- DIR: Set to a number representing the direction to move;\r - 2: left, 4: right, 8: up 2: down,\r - 1: lower left, 3: lower right, 7: upper left, 9: upper right,\r - 5: current direction, 0: reverse direction\r- AMOUNT: The amount to move in that direction, in pixels\r- MULTIPLIER: multiplies against amount to make larger values easier [OPTIONAL]\r\rExample:\r~~~\r qmove(4, 24)\r~~~\rWill move that character 24 pixels to the left.\r\r### Arc\r\rArcing is used to make a character orbit around a position. Note that collisions\rare ignored when arcing, but interactions still work. To add a arc add a script\rin the move route in the format:\r~~~\r arc(PIVOTX, PIVOTY, RADIAN, CCWISE?, FRAMES)\r~~~\r- PIVOTX: The x position to orbit around, in pixels\r- PIVOTY: The y position to orbit around, in pixels\r- RADIAN: The degrees to move, in radians\r- CCWISE?: set to true or false; if true it will arc countclock wise\r- FRAMES: The amount of frames to complete the arc\r\rExample:\r~~~\r arc(480,480,Math.PI*2,false,60)\r~~~\rWill make the character do a full 360 arc clockwise around the point 480, 480\rand it'll take 60 frames.\r\n\n## Plugin Commands\r\r### Transfer\r\rMV event transfers are grid based. So this plugin command lets you map transfer\rto a pixel x / y position.\r~~~\r qMovement transfer [MAPID] [X] [Y] [OPTIONS]\r~~~\r- MAPID: The id of the map to transfer to\r- X: The x position to transfer to, in pixels\r- Y: The y position to transfer to, in pixels\r\rPossible options:\r\r- dirX: Set X to the dir to face after the transfer.\r  - Can be 2, 4, 6, 8, or for diagonals 1, 3, 7, 9\r- fadeBlack: Will fade black when transfering\r- fadeWhite: Will fade white when transfering\r\rExample:\r~~~\r qMovement transfer 1 100 116 dir2 fadeBlack\r~~~\rWill transfer the player to map 1 at x100, y116. There will be a black fade\rand player will be facing down\r~~~\r qMovement transfer 1 100 116\r~~~\rWill transfer the player to map 1 at x100, y116. There will be no fade and\rplayers direction won't change\r\r### Set Pos\r\rThis command will let you move a character to a x / y pixel position. Note\rthis will not \"walk\" the character to that position! This will place the\rcharacter at this position, similar to a transfer.\r~~~\r qMovement setPos [CHARAID] [X] [Y] [OPTIONS]\r~~~\r- CHARAID: The character identifier.\r  - For player: 0, p, or player\r  - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID, eventEVENTID or this for the event that called this (replace EVENTID with a number)\r- X: The x position to set to, in pixels\r- Y: The y position to set to, in pixels\r\rPossible options:\r\r- dirX: Set X to the dir to face after the transfer.\r  - Can be 2, 4, 6, 8, or for diagonals 1, 3, 7, 9\r\n\n## Tips\r\r### No closed open spaces!\r\rFor performance reasons, you should try to avoid having open spaces that are\rclosed off.\r\r![Example](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qmovement/openSpaces.png)\r\rOn the left we can see some tiles that have a collider border, but their inside\ris \"open\". This issue is should be corrected when using QPathfind because\rif someone was to click inside that \"open\" space, it is passable and QPathfind\rwill try to find a way in even though there is no way in and will cause massive\rlag. The fix can be pretty simple, you could add a CollisionMap (though that\rmay be another issue in its own) or add a RegionCollider to fill up the full\rtile like I did on the correct side of that image.\r\r### Collision Maps - Heavy\r\rTry to use collision maps only if you absolutely need to. Collision maps\rcan be very large images which will make your game use more memory and can\rcause some slower pcs to start lagging. The collision checking for collision\rmaps are also take about 2-4x more time to compute and is a lot less accurate\rsince it only checks if the colliders edge collided with the collision map.\rSo using collision maps, might be pretty, but use it with caution as it can\rslow down your game! A better solution for this would be to use a PolygonMap\rwhere you create polygon colliders and add them into the map.\r\n\n## Addons\r\r### Pathfind\r\rhttps://quxios.github.io/#/plugins/QPathfind\r\rQPathfind is an A* pathfinding algorithm. This algorithm can be pretty heavy\rif you are doing pixel based movements. So avoid having to many pathfinders\rrunning at the same time.\r\rFor the interval settings, you want to set this to a value where the path\rcan be found in 1-3 frames. You can think of intervals as the number of\rmoves to try per frame. The default setting 100, is good for grid based\rsince that will take you 100 grid spaces away. But for a pixel based, 100\rsteps might not be as far. If most of your pathfinds will be short (paths less then\r10 tiles away), then you should set this to a value between 100-300. For medium\rpaths (10-20 tiles away) try a value between 300-700. For large or complicated\rpaths (20+ tiles away or lots of obsticles) try something between 1000-2000.\rI would avoid going over 2000. My opinion is to keep it below 1000, and simplify\rany of your larger paths by either splitting it into multiple pathfinds or\rjust making the path less complex.\r\r\r### Collision Map\r\rhttps://quxios.github.io/#/plugins/QM+CollisionMap\r\rCollision Map is an addon for this plugin that lets you use images for\rcollisions. Note that collision map checks are a lot heavier then normal\rcollision checks. So this plugin can make your game laggier if used with\rother heavy plugins.\r\r\r### Region Colliders\r\rhttps://quxios.github.io/#/plugins/QM+RegionColliders\r\rRegion Colliders is an addon for this plugin that lets you add colliders\rto regions by creating a json file.\r\n\n## Videos\r\rGreat example of using the collision map addon:\r\rhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BN4Pyr5IBo\r\rIf you have a video you'd like to have listed here, feel free to send me a\rlink in the RPGMakerWebs thread!

    "about": "\n## About\r\rThis plugin lets you use sprites that are set up with QSprite Editor\r\rhttps://github.com/quxios/QSpriteEditor\r\r",
    "help": "\n## How to use\r\rFirst configure your sprite with the QSprite Editor. Then you can use your\rsprites by identifying it as a QSprite. To do so, just name your sprite file\rby using the File Name Identifier format. By default this is:\r~~~\r %{config}-\r~~~\rYou would replace {config} with the config you made inside the QSprite\rEditor. For example, if I made a config named: `Hero` then I would name\rthe file something like: `%Hero-Example.png`\r\n\n## Built-in Poses\r\rThis plugin adds a few built in poses:\r- moveX\r- dashX\r- idleX\r- idle[A-Z]X ( more info for this below )\r- default\r\rWhere X is the direction:\r- 2: down\r- 4: left\r- 6: right\r- 8: up\r- 1: lower left\r- 3: lower right\r- 7: upper left\r- 9: upper right\r\r*(Diagonals only work if you are using this with QMovement)*\r\rDefault pose is used when and idleX or moveX is not found. Note that default\rdoes not have an X at the end, it's just default. Has no directions tied to\rit.\r\r\r### idle[A-Z]X\r\rThis is a random idle that will play a random `idle[A-Z]` every X frames.\rThe random wait depends on the `Random Idle Interval` parameter. To clarify\ryou won't be naming this pose `idle[A-Z]2` (for example for the down direction)\ryou would name it `idleA2` or `idleB2` or `idleC2`, ect.\r\rYou can also add in a multipier if you want one of the idles to appear more\roften then others by adding: `Tx` Where T is the multipler.\r\rFor example:\r\rLets say I want 4 `idle[A-Z]` poses, and I want one of them to have a 4 times\rbetter chance of appearing then the rest. My idle names would be:\r\r- idleA2\r- idleB2\r- idleC2\r- idleD4x2\r\r*Note: all their directions are 2(down)*\r\n\n## Notetags / Comments\r\r### Set default direction\r\rWith spritesheets being large, it may be hard to pick that events starting\rdirection. To fix that, you can add a comment in that event that will set\rit's default direction.\r~~~\r <direction:X>\r~~~\rSet X to direction. 2 for down, 4 left, 6 right, 8 up.\r\n\n## Plugin Commands\r\r### Playing a Pose\r\rPlay a pose.\r~~~\r qSprite [CHARAID] play [POSE] [list of options]\r~~~\r- CHARAID: The character identifier.\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID, eventEVENTID or this for the event that called this\r (replace EVENTID with a number)\r- POSE: The pose to play (Don’t add the direction! ex: atk, not atk2)\r\rPossible options:\r- lock: Disable character movement while pose is playing\r- pause: Pause the pose on the last frame\r- breakable: If character moves, the pose will end\r- wait: Next Event Command runs once pose is complete\r\r\r### Looping a Pose\r\rLoop a pose until it's cleared, broken out of or played over.\r~~~\r qSprite [CHARAID] loop [POSE] [list of options]\r~~~\r- CHARAID: The character identifier.\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID, eventEVENTID or this for the event that called this\r (replace EVENTID with a number)\r- POSE: The pose to play (Don’t add the direction! ex: atk, not atk2)\r\rPossible options:\r- lock: Disable character movement while pose is playing\r- breakable: If character moves, the loop will end\r- wait: Next Event Command runs once first loop has is complete\r\r### Clearing\r\rClear current playing/looping pose.\r~~~\r qSprite [CHARAID] clear\r~~~\r- CHARAID: The character identifier.\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID, eventEVENTID or this for the event that called this\r (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\r### Add / Remove an idle[A-Z]\r\rMaybe you only want to play an idle[A-Z] during certain scenes.

Set to default when you want that\r collider to be used when ever the type isn't found. Set to collision, for\r that collider to be used as a collision. Set to other values if needed\r for example, if a certain type is needed for a plugin feature.\r- SHAPE: Box or circle (only box works unless QMovement is installed)\r- WIDTH: The width of the collider, in pixels\r- HEIGHT: The height of the collider, in pixels\r- OX: The X Offset of the collider, in pixels\r- OY: The Y Offset of the collider, in pixels\r\r### OnPlayer\r\rExperimental feature, might be changed / renamed\r\rAt the moment, this note will change this map objects alpha to 0.5 when\rthe player is behind it. This feature requires a default or interaction\rcollider.\r~~~\r <onPlayer>\r~~~\rJust add that note to the map object to have this feature, then include\ra collider.\r\r### Breath\r\rAdds a breathing effect to the map object. A breathing effect is where the\rthe sprites scale is increased and decreased in a sin wave.\r~~~\r <breath:OFFSET,DURATION,INITIALTIME?>\r~~~\r- OFFSET: How much to scale. 1 is 100%, 0.5 is 50%. So 0.5 means its\r scale will go between 0.5 and 1.5;\r- DURATION: How long it takes for 1 cycle, in frames. 60 frames = 1 second\r- INITIALTIME: (Optional, Default: 0) Which frame should it start at. Ex;\r if DURATION was 60 and this is set at 30, it'll start in the middle of the\r cycle.\r\r### Tint\r\rChange the tint of the map object. Similar to the Tint Screen event command.\r~~~\r <tint:RED,GREEN,BLUE,GRAY>\r~~~\r- RED: Red value of tint, set between -255 to 255. Default: 0\r- GREEN: Red value of tint, set between -255 to 255. Default: 0\r- BLUE: Red value of tint, set between -255 to 255. Default: 0\r- GRAY: Red value of tint, set between -255 to 255.

One for the keyboard input and 1 for the gamepad input. This plugin\ronly remaps the first input. So for example:\r\rLets say you had `enter` action as:\r~~~\r#space, #e, $A\r~~~\rWhen the player goes to remap the enter key, they'll see either Space or A,\rdepending on which input they are currenting using. So they will never be able\rto remap the #e key. Now in some cases this may be fine. But just know that\rthe only the 1st instance of the input type is remappable!\r\r\n\n## Links\r\rRPGMakerWebs:\r\r  http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/qplugins.73023/\r\rTerms of use:\r\r  https://github.com/quxios/QMV-Master-Demo/blob/master/readme.md\r\r",
