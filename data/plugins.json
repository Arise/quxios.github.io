    "help": "\n## How to use\n\nFirst configure your sprite with the Sprite Animator. Then you can use your\nsprites by identifying it as a QSprite. To do so, just name your sprite file\nby using the File Name Identifier format. By default this is:\n~~~\n  %{config}-\n~~~\nYou would replace {config} with the config you made inside the Sprite\nAnimator. For example, if I made a config named: `Hero` then I would name\nthe file something like: `%Hero-Example.png`\n\n\n## Built-in Poses\n\nThis plugin adds a few built in poses:\n - moveX\n - dashX\n - idleX\n - idle[A-Z]X ( more info for this below )\n\nWhere X is the direction:\n\n - 2 - down\n - 4 - left\n - 6 - right\n - 8 - up\n - 1 - lower left\n - 3 - lower right\n - 7 - upper left\n - 9 - upper right\n\n(Diagonals only work if you are using this with Quasi Movement)\n\n\n**idle[A-Z]X**\n\nThis is a random idle that will play a random `idle[A-Z]` every X frames.\nThe random wait depends on the `Random Idle Interval` parameter. To clarify\nyou won't be naming this pose `idle[A-Z]2` (for example for the down direction)\nyou would name it `idleA2` or `idleB2` or `idleC2`, ect.\n\nYou can also add in a multipier if you want one of the idles to appear more\noften then others by adding: `Tx` Where T is the multipler.\n\nFor example:\n\nLets say I want 4 `idle[A-Z]` poses, and I want one of them to have a 4 times\nbetter chance of appearing then the rest. My idle names would be:\n\n  - idleA2\n  - idleB2\n  - idleC2\n  - idleD4x2\n\n(Note: all their directions are 2(down))\n\n\n## Plugin Commands\n\n**Playing a Pose**\n\nPlay a pose.\n~~~\n  qSprite [CHARAID] play [POSE] [list of options]\n~~~\nCHARAID - The character identifier.\n\n - For player: 0, p, or player\n - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID or eventEVENTID\n (replace EVENTID with a number)\n\nPOSE    - The pose to play (Don’t add the direction! ex: atk, not atk2)\n\nPossible options:\n\n - lock      - Disable character movement while pose is playing\n - pause     - Pause the pose on the last frame\n - breakable - If character moves, the pose will end\n - wait      - Next Event Command runs once pose is complete\n\n\n**Looping a Pose**\n\nLoop a pose until it's cleared, broken out of or played over.\n~~~\n  qSprite [CHARAID] loop [POSE] [list of options]\n~~~\nCHARAID - The character identifier.\n\n - For player: 0, p, or player\n - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID or eventEVENTID\n (replace EVENTID with a number)\n\nPOSE    - The pose to play (Don’t add the direction! ex: atk, not atk2)\n\nPossible options:\n\n - lock      - Disable character movement while pose is playing\n - breakable - If character moves, the loop will end\n - wait      - Next Event Command runs once first loop has is complete\n\n**Clearing**\n\nClear current playing/looping pose.\n~~~\n  qSprite [CHARAID] clear\n~~~\nCHARAID - The character identifier.\n\n**Examples**\n\n~~~\n  qSprite 0 play confused pause breakable\n  qSprite p play confused pause breakable\n  qSprite player play confused pause breakable\n~~~\n(Note: All 3 are the same, just using a different character id method)\n\nThe player will run the `confused` pose. The pose will stop on the last frame.\nOnce the player moves, the pose will end. The player can move during this pose\nand the next event command will run immediatly after this command with no\nwait.\n\n\n~~~\n  qSprite 1 play hug wait\n  qSprite e1 play hug wait\n  qSprite event1 play hug wait\n~~~\nEvent 1 will run the hug pose. The event can't move until the pose is\ncomplete, and the next event command will run once the pose is complete.\n\n\n## Links\n\nRPGMakerWebs:\n\n  http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/----\n\nSprite App:\n\n  https://github.com/quxios/SpriteAnimator\n\nTerms of use:\n\n  https://github.com/quxios/QMV-Master-Demo/blob/master/readme.md\n\n"
