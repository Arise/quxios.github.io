    "about": "\n## About\r\rThis plugin lets you use sprites that are set up with Quasi Sprite Animator\r\rhttps://github.com/quxios/SpriteAnimator\r\r",
    "help": "\n## How to use\r\rFirst configure your sprite with the Sprite Animator. Then you can use your\rsprites by identifying it as a QSprite. To do so, just name your sprite file\rby using the File Name Identifier format. By default this is:\r~~~\r  %{config}-\r~~~\rYou would replace {config} with the config you made inside the Sprite\rAnimator. For example, if I made a config named: `Hero` then I would name\rthe file something like: `%Hero-Example.png`\r\n\n## Built-in Poses\r\rThis plugin adds a few built in poses:\r - moveX\r - dashX\r - idleX\r - idle[A-Z]X ( more info for this below )\r - default\r\rWhere X is the direction:\r\r - 2 - down\r - 4 - left\r - 6 - right\r - 8 - up\r - 1 - lower left\r - 3 - lower right\r - 7 - upper left\r - 9 - upper right\r\r(Diagonals only work if you are using this with Quasi Movement)\r\rDefault pose is used when and idleX or moveX is not found. Note that default\rdoes not have an X at the end, it's just default. Has no directions tied to\rit.\r\r\r**idle[A-Z]X**\r\rThis is a random idle that will play a random `idle[A-Z]` every X frames.\rThe random wait depends on the `Random Idle Interval` parameter. To clarify\ryou won't be naming this pose `idle[A-Z]2` (for example for the down direction)\ryou would name it `idleA2` or `idleB2` or `idleC2`, ect.\r\rYou can also add in a multipier if you want one of the idles to appear more\roften then others by adding: `Tx` Where T is the multipler.\r\rFor example:\r\rLets say I want 4 `idle[A-Z]` poses, and I want one of them to have a 4 times\rbetter chance of appearing then the rest. My idle names would be:\r\r  - idleA2\r  - idleB2\r  - idleC2\r  - idleD4x2\r\r(Note: all their directions are 2(down))\r\n\n## Notetags / Comments\r\r**Set default direction**\r\rWith spritesheets being large, it may be hard to pick that events starting\rdirection. To fix that, you can add a comment in that event that will set\rit's default direction.\r```\r  <direction:X>\r```\rSet X to direction. 2 for down, 4 left, 6 right, 8 up.\r\n\n## Plugin Commands\r\r**Playing a Pose**\r\rPlay a pose.\r~~~\r  qSprite [CHARAID] play [POSE] [list of options]\r~~~\rCHARAID - The character identifier.\r\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID or eventEVENTID\r (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\rPOSE    - The pose to play (Don’t add the direction! ex: atk, not atk2)\r\rPossible options:\r\r - lock      - Disable character movement while pose is playing\r - pause     - Pause the pose on the last frame\r - breakable - If character moves, the pose will end\r - wait      - Next Event Command runs once pose is complete\r\r\r**Looping a Pose**\r\rLoop a pose until it's cleared, broken out of or played over.\r~~~\r  qSprite [CHARAID] loop [POSE] [list of options]\r~~~\rCHARAID - The character identifier.\r\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID or eventEVENTID\r (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\rPOSE    - The pose to play (Don’t add the direction! ex: atk, not atk2)\r\rPossible options:\r\r - lock      - Disable character movement while pose is playing\r - breakable - If character moves, the loop will end\r - wait      - Next Event Command runs once first loop has is complete\r\r**Clearing**\r\rClear current playing/looping pose.\r~~~\r  qSprite [CHARAID] clear\r~~~\rCHARAID - The character identifier.\r\r**Add / Remove an idle[A-Z]**\r\rMaybe you only want to play an idle[A-Z] during certain scenes.

The pose will stop on the last frame.\rOnce the player moves, the pose will end.

    "help": "\n## Plugin Commands\r\r**Setting custom move speed**\r\r~~~\r  qSpeed [CHARAID] set [MOVESPEED] [list of options]\r~~~\rCHARAID   - The character identifier.\r\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID or eventEVENTID\r (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\rMOVESPEED - The speed to set the character too. Can be a float; ex: 3.5\r\rPossible options:\r\r - accel - Character needs to accelerate / decelerate to this new speed.\r\r\r**Enabling Acceleration**\r\r~~~\r  qSpeed [CHARAID] enableAccel\r~~~\rCHARAID   - The character identifier.\r\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID or eventEVENTID\r (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\r**Disabling Acceleration**\r\r~~~\r  qSpeed [CHARAID] disableAccel\r~~~\rCHARAID   - The character identifier.\r\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID or eventEVENTID\r (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\r**Setting Acceleration time**\r\r~~~\r  qSpeed [CHARAID] duration [TIME]\r~~~\rCHARAID   - The character identifier.\r\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID or eventEVENTID\r (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\rTIME      - The time in frames it takes the character to reach new speeds.\r\r**Examples**\r\r~~~\r  qSpeed 1 set 3.65\r  qSpeed e1 set 3.65\r  qSpeed event1 set 3.65\r~~~\r(Note: All 3 are the same, just using a different character id method)\r\rEvent 1 will have it's move speed set to 3.65. Since there's no accel option\rhe won't accel to the new speed, it will be applied instantly.\r\r~~~\r  qSpeed 1 set 3.5 accel\r  qSpeed e1 set 3.5 accel\r  qSpeed event1 set 3.5 accel\r~~~\r(Note: All 3 are the same, just using a different character id method)\r\rEvent 1 will have it's move speed set to 4.5. Since there's a accel option\rhe will accel to the new speed.\r\r~~~\r  qSpeed 0 duration 60\r  qSpeed p1 duration 60\r  qSpeed player duration 60\r~~~\r(Note: All 3 are the same, just using a different character id method)\r\rThe player's accel duration will be set to 60. This means it will take him\r60 frames to reach his new speed. Unless his acceleration is disabled.\r\n\n## Notes\r\r**Setting default custom move speed**\r\rAdding the following to the notes or in a comment will make that event use\rthis custom speed by default\r~~~\r  <speed:X>\r~~~\rX  - The speed to set the character too. Can be a float; ex: 3.5\r\n\n## Links\r\rRPGMakerWebs:\r\r  http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/qplugins.73023/\r\rTerms of use:\r\r  https://github.com/quxios/QMV-Master-Demo/blob/master/readme.md\r\r"
