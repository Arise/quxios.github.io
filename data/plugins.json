    "about": "\n## About\r\n\r\nThis plugin lets you use sprites that are set up with Quasi Sprite Animator\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/quxios/SpriteAnimator\r\n\r\n",
    "help": "\n## How to use\r\n\r\nFirst configure your sprite with the Sprite Animator. Then you can use your\r\nsprites by identifying it as a QSprite. To do so, just name your sprite file\r\nby using the File Name Identifier format. By default this is:\r\n~~~\r\n  %{config}-\r\n~~~\r\nYou would replace {config} with the config you made inside the Sprite\r\nAnimator. For example, if I made a config named: `Hero` then I would name\r\nthe file something like: `%Hero-Example.png`\r\n\n\n## Built-in Poses\r\n\r\nThis plugin adds a few built in poses:\r\n - moveX\r\n - dashX\r\n - idleX\r\n - idle[A-Z]X ( more info for this below )\r\n - default\r\n\r\nWhere X is the direction:\r\n\r\n - 2 - down\r\n - 4 - left\r\n - 6 - right\r\n - 8 - up\r\n - 1 - lower left\r\n - 3 - lower right\r\n - 7 - upper left\r\n - 9 - upper right\r\n\r\n(Diagonals only work if you are using this with Quasi Movement)\r\n\r\nDefault pose is used when and idleX or moveX is not found. Note that default\r\ndoes not have an X at the end, it's just default. Has no directions tied to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n**idle[A-Z]X**\r\n\r\nThis is a random idle that will play a random `idle[A-Z]` every X frames.\r\nThe random wait depends on the `Random Idle Interval` parameter. To clarify\r\nyou won't be naming this pose `idle[A-Z]2` (for example for the down direction)\r\nyou would name it `idleA2` or `idleB2` or `idleC2`, ect.\r\n\r\nYou can also add in a multipier if you want one of the idles to appear more\r\noften then others by adding: `Tx` Where T is the multipler.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nLets say I want 4 `idle[A-Z]` poses, and I want one of them to have a 4 times\r\nbetter chance of appearing then the rest. My idle names would be:\r\n\r\n  - idleA2\r\n  - idleB2\r\n  - idleC2\r\n  - idleD4x2\r\n\r\n(Note: all their directions are 2(down))\r\n\n\n## Notetags / Comments\r\n\r\n**Set default direction**\r\n\r\nWith spritesheets being large, it may be hard to pick that events starting\r\ndirection. To fix that, you can add a comment in that event that will set\r\nit's default direction.\r\n```\r\n  <direction:X>\r\n```\r\nSet X to direction. 2 for down, 4 left, 6 right, 8 up.\r\n\n\n## Plugin Commands\r\n\r\n**Playing a Pose**\r\n\r\nPlay a pose.\r\n~~~\r\n  qSprite [CHARAID] play [POSE] [list of options]\r\n~~~\r\nCHARAID - The character identifier.\r\n\r\n - For player: 0, p, or player\r\n - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID or eventEVENTID\r\n (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\n\r\nPOSE    - The pose to play (Don’t add the direction! ex: atk, not atk2)\r\n\r\nPossible options:\r\n\r\n - lock      - Disable character movement while pose is playing\r\n - pause     - Pause the pose on the last frame\r\n - breakable - If character moves, the pose will end\r\n - wait      - Next Event Command runs once pose is complete\r\n\r\n\r\n**Looping a Pose**\r\n\r\nLoop a pose until it's cleared, broken out of or played over.\r\n~~~\r\n  qSprite [CHARAID] loop [POSE] [list of options]\r\n~~~\r\nCHARAID - The character identifier.\r\n\r\n - For player: 0, p, or player\r\n - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID or eventEVENTID\r\n (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\n\r\nPOSE    - The pose to play (Don’t add the direction! ex: atk, not atk2)\r\n\r\nPossible options:\r\n\r\n - lock      - Disable character movement while pose is playing\r\n - breakable - If character moves, the loop will end\r\n - wait      - Next Event Command runs once first loop has is complete\r\n\r\n**Clearing**\r\n\r\nClear current playing/looping pose.\r\n~~~\r\n  qSprite [CHARAID] clear\r\n~~~\r\nCHARAID - The character identifier.\r\n\r\n**Add / Remove an idle[A-Z]**\r\n\r\nMaybe you only want to play an idle[A-Z] during certain scenes.

    "about": "\n## About\r\n\r\nThis plugin lets you set custom move speeds for your characters. It also\r\nadds an acceleration / deceleration effect when that characters move speed\r\nis changing. This can be enabled / disabled.\r\n",
    "help": "\n## Plugin Commands\r\n\r\n**Setting custom move speed**\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n  qSpeed [CHARAID] set [MOVESPEED] [list of options]\r\n~~~\r\nCHARAID   - The character identifier.\r\n\r\n - For player: 0, p, or player\r\n - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID or eventEVENTID\r\n (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\n\r\nMOVESPEED - The speed to set the character too. Can be a float; ex: 3.5\r\n\r\nPossible options:\r\n\r\n - accel - Character needs to accelerate / decelerate to this new speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Enabling Acceleration**\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n  qSpeed [CHARAID] enableAccel\r\n~~~\r\nCHARAID   - The character identifier.\r\n\r\n - For player: 0, p, or player\r\n - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID or eventEVENTID\r\n (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\n\r\n**Disabling Acceleration**\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n  qSpeed [CHARAID] disableAccel\r\n~~~\r\nCHARAID   - The character identifier.\r\n\r\n - For player: 0, p, or player\r\n - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID or eventEVENTID\r\n (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\n\r\n**Setting Acceleration time**\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n  qSpeed [CHARAID] duration [TIME]\r\n~~~\r\nCHARAID   - The character identifier.\r\n\r\n - For player: 0, p, or player\r\n - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID or eventEVENTID\r\n (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\n\r\nTIME      - The time in frames it takes the character to reach new speeds.\r\n\r\n**Examples**\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n  qSpeed 1 set 3.65\r\n  qSpeed e1 set 3.65\r\n  qSpeed event1 set 3.65\r\n~~~\r\n(Note: All 3 are the same, just using a different character id method)\r\n\r\nEvent 1 will have it's move speed set to 3.65. Since there's no accel option\r\nhe won't accel to the new speed, it will be applied instantly.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n  qSpeed 1 set 3.5 accel\r\n  qSpeed e1 set 3.5 accel\r\n  qSpeed event1 set 3.5 accel\r\n~~~\r\n(Note: All 3 are the same, just using a different character id method)\r\n\r\nEvent 1 will have it's move speed set to 4.5. Since there's a accel option\r\nhe will accel to the new speed.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n  qSpeed 0 duration 60\r\n  qSpeed p1 duration 60\r\n  qSpeed player duration 60\r\n~~~\r\n(Note: All 3 are the same, just using a different character id method)\r\n\r\nThe player's accel duration will be set to 60. This means it will take him\r\n60 frames to reach his new speed. Unless his acceleration is disabled.\r\n\n\n## Notes\r\n\r\n**Setting default custom move speed**\r\n\r\nAdding the following to the notes or in a comment will make that event use\r\nthis custom speed by default\r\n~~~\r\n  <speed:X>\r\n~~~\r\nX  - The speed to set the character too. Can be a float; ex: 3.5\r\n\n\n## Links\r\n\r\nRPGMakerWebs:\r\n\r\n  http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?/topic/73023-qplugins/\r\n\r\nTerms of use:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/quxios/QMV-Master-Demo/blob/master/readme.md\r\n\r\n"
