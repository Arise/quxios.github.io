It also adds a few new\rfunctionality to RPG Maker MV to improve it.\r\r","help":"\n## Notetags / Comments\r\r### Event retain direction\r\rAdding the following to the notes or in a comment will make that event retain\rits direction when changing pages.\r~~~\r <retainDir>\r~~~\rThis will be ignored if the next page has direction fix enabled\r\r\r### No tilemap\r\rYou can disable the tile map by adding this note to a map\r~~~\r <noTilemap>\r~~~\rThis will replace the tilemap with a simple light weight sprite container.\rUsing this may increase performance. So if you have a map that doesn't use\rany tiles and is all parallax, then you should considering using this.\r\r*Note, there's a chance this may break some plugins if they call functions in\rthe original tilemap class.*\r\r\n\n## Format Plugin Commands\r\rThese formating options are only applied to QPlugins!\r\r### Spaces in arg\r\rEach arg is separated with a space. But sometimes you may need a space, for\rexample when passing a file name. To do this you just need to wrap it in quotes\rand it'll be passed as a single arg, ex:\r~~~\r qPlugin cmd arg1 \"arg2 with a space\" arg3\r~~~\r\r\r### Variables\r\rIf you want to use a value of a variable in a plugin command you can do so \rwith the following format:\r~~~\r{vID}\r~~~\r- ID: The id of the variable to use\r\rExample:\r~~~\r qPlugin cmd arg1 chara{v1}\r~~~\rWhen the plugin command runs the {v1} will get replaced with the value of\rvariable 1. If the value of variable 1 is 10, , then your plugin command will\rformat to: `qPlugin cmd arg1 chara10`\r\r### Switches\r\rIf you want to use a value of a switch in a plugin command you can do so\rwith the following format:\r~~~\r{sID}\r~~~\r- ID: The id of the switch to use\r\rExample:\r~~~\r qPlugin cmd arg1 {s1}\r~~~\rWhen the plugin command runs the {s1} will get replaced with the value of\rswitch 1. If the value of switch 1 is true, then your plugin command will\rformat to: `qPlugin cmd arg1 true`\r\r\n\n## Plugin Commands\r\r### Random wait between X Y\r\rThis plugin command will insert a random wait between x and y frames.\r~~~\r wait X Y\r~~~\rIf Y is left empty, it will make a random wait between 0 - X\r\r\r### Global Lock\r\rThis plugin command will 'lock' all characters or certain characters. By\rlocking I mean you can lock their movement, or movement and character\ranimation.\r~~~\r globalLock LEVEL [CHARACTERS] [options]\r~~~\r- LEVEL: The level of global lock\r * 0: clears the global lock\r * 1: locks the characters movement\r * 2: locks the characters movement and animation\r- [CHARACTERS] - optional, list of `Character Ids` to apply to or ignore. Seperated by a space.\r * CHARAID: The character identifier.\r  - For player: 0, p, or player\r  - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID, eventEVENTID or this for the event that called this\r  (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\rPossible options:\r - only: Will only apply to the characters listed\r\r\r### Global lock Examples\r\r~~~\r globalLock 2\r~~~\rWill lock all characters movement and animations.\r\r~~~\r globalLock 1 0 1 4\r globalLock 1 p e1 e4\r globalLock 1 player event1 event4\r~~~\r(Note: All 3 are the same, just using a different character id method)\r\rWill Lock the movements for all characters except:\rPlayer, event 1 and event 4\r\r~~~\r globalLock 1 0 1 4 only\r globalLock 1 p e1 e4 only\r globalLock 1 player event1 event4 only\r~~~\rWill Lock the movements for only these characters:\rPlayer, event 1 and event 4\r\r\n\n## Links\r\rFormated Help:\r\r https://quxios.github.io/#/plugins/QPlus\r\rRPGMakerWebs:\r\r http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/qplugins.73023/\r\rTerms of use:\r\r https://github.com/quxios/QMV-Master-Demo/blob/master/readme.md\r\rLike my plugins?

Using\rcolliders enabled more accurate collision checking with dealing with pixel\rmovement. This plugin also lets you change how many pixels the characters\rmove per step, letting you set up a 24x24 movement or a 1x1 (pixel movement)\r\rNote there are a few mv features disabled/broken; mouse movement, followers,\rand vehicles.\r","help":"\n## Setting up\r\rTo setup a pixel based movement, you'll need to change the plugin parameters\rto something like:\r\r- Grid = 1\r- Off Grid = true\r- Mid Pass = false\r\rOther parameters can be set to your preference.\r\rFor a grid based movement, set it something like:\r\r- Grid = GRIDSIZE YOU WANT\r- Off Grid = false\r- Mid Pass = true\r\rWhen in grid based movement, you want your colliders to fill up most of the\rgrid size but with a padding of 4 pixels on all sides (this is because some\rtile colliders are 4 tiles wide or tall). So if your grid size was 48, your\rcolliders shouldn't be 48x48, instead they should be 40x40, with an ox and oy\rof 4. So your collider setting would look like: box, 40, 40, 4, 4\r\n\n## Colliders\r\rThere are 3 types of colliders; Polygon, Box and Circle. Though you can only\rcreate box and circle colliders, unless you modify the code to accept\rpolygons. This is intentional since polygon would be \"harder\" to setup.\r\r![Colliders Image](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qmovement/colliders.png)\r\r- Boxes takes in width, height, offset x and offset y\r- Circles similar to boxes, takes in width, height, offset x and offset y\r\r### Setting up colliders\r\rColliders are setup inside the Players notebox or as a comment inside an\rEvents page. Events colliders depends it's page, so you may need to make the\rcollider on all pages.\r\rThere are two ways to setup colliders. using `<collider:-,-,-,->` and using\r`<colliders>-</colliders>`. The first method sets the 'Default' collider for\rthat character. The second one you create the colliders for every collider\rtype.\r\r### Collider Types\r\rThere are 3 collider types. Default, Collision and Interaction.\r- Default: This is the collider to use if collider type that was called was\rnot found\r- Collision: This collider is used for collision checking\r- Interaction: This collider is used for checking interaction.\r\r### Collider Presets\r\rYou can create colliders in the plugin parameters which you can use when\rsetting up other colliders.\r\r### Collider Terms\r\r![Colliders Terms Image](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qmovement/colliderInfo.png)\r\r### Collider Notetag\r\r~~~\r <collider: [SHAPE], [WIDTH], [HEIGHT], [OX], [OY]>\r~~~\rThis notetag sets all collider types to these values.\r- SHAPE: Set to box, circle or poly\r  - If poly read next section on poly shape\r- WIDTH: The width of the collider, in pixels\r- HEIGHT: The height of the collider, in pixels\r- OX: The X Offset of the collider, in pixels\r- OY: The Y Offset of the collider, in pixels\r\r### Colliders Notetag\r\r~~~\r <colliders>\r [TYPE]: [SHAPE], [WIDTH], [HEIGHT], [OX], [OY]\r </colliders>\r~~~\rThis notetag sets all collider types to these values.\r- TYPE: The type of collider, set to default, collision or interaction\r- SHAPE: Set to box, circle or poly\r  - If poly read next section on poly shape\r- WIDTH: The width of the collider, in pixels\r- HEIGHT: The height of the collider, in pixels\r- OX: The X Offset of the collider, in pixels\r- OY: The Y Offset of the collider, in pixels\r\rTo add another type, just add `type: shape, width, height, ox, oy` on\ranother line.\r\rExample:\r~~~\r <colliders>\r default: box, 48, 48\r collision: circle, 24, 24, 12, 12\r interaction: box, 32, 32, 8, 8\r </colliders>\r~~~\r\r### Using Preset\r\rTo use a collider preset in the notetag, the format is:\r~~~\r preset, [PRESETID]\r~~~\r- PRESETID: The PresetID you set in the preset parameter.\r\rYou will use this format instead of the: `SHAPE, WIDTH, HEIGHT, OX, OY`\r\rExample:\r~~~\r <collider: preset, largeCollider>\r~~~\rWill look for the preset with the ID `largeCollider`\r\rExample 2:\r~~~\r <colliders>\r default: preset, largeDefault\r collision: preset, largeCollider\r interaction: preset, largeInteraction\r </colliders>\r~~~\rWill use the presets; `largeDefault`, `largeCollider`, and `largeInteraction`\r\r### Poly Colliders\r\rTo create a polygon collider, set the shape to poly. After that the rest\rof the line should be a list of points separated with a comma. Points are\rwritten as \"(X,Y)\". An example polygon would be:\r~~~\r poly,(24,0),(48,24),(24,48),(0,24)\r~~~\rWould create a diamond shaped polygon.\r\rExample of using it inside a collider tag\r~~~\r <collider:poly,(24,0),(48,24),(24,48),(0,24)>\r~~~\r\n\n## Move Routes\r\rBy default, event move commands (moveup, movedown, ect) will convert to a\rqmove that moves the character based off your tilesize. So if your tilesize\ris 48 and your gridsize is 1. Then a moveup command will move the character\rup 48 pixels not 1. But if you want to move the character by a fixed amount\rof pixels, then you will use the QMove commands.\r\r### QMove\r\r![QMove Script Call](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qmovement/qmove.png)\r\rTo do a QMove, add a script in the move route in the format:\r~~~\r qmove(DIR, AMOUNT, MULTIPLER)\r~~~\r- DIR: Set to a number representing the direction to move;\r - 4: left, 6: right, 8: up 2: down,\r - 1: lower left, 3: lower right, 7: upper left, 9: upper right,\r - 5: current direction, 0: reverse direction\r- AMOUNT: The amount to move in that direction, in pixels\r- MULTIPLIER: multiplies against amount to make larger values easier [OPTIONAL]\r\rExample:\r~~~\r qmove(4, 24)\r~~~\rWill move that character 24 pixels to the left.\r\r### Arc\r\rArcing is used to make a character orbit around a position. Note that collisions\rare ignored when arcing, but interactions still work. To add a arc add a script\rin the move route in the format:\r~~~\r arc(PIVOTX, PIVOTY, RADIAN, CCWISE?, FRAMES)\r~~~\r- PIVOTX: The x position to orbit around, in pixels\r- PIVOTY: The y position to orbit around, in pixels\r- RADIAN: The degrees to move, in radians\r- CCWISE?: set to true or false; if true it will arc countclock wise\r- FRAMES: The amount of frames to complete the arc\r\rExample:\r~~~\r arc(480,480,Math.PI*2,false,60)\r~~~\rWill make the character do a full 360 arc clockwise around the point 480, 480\rand it'll take 60 frames.\r\n\n## Event Notetags/Comments\r\r### Offsets\r\rTo shift an events initial starting position, you can use the following\rnote tags:\r~~~\r <ox:X>\r~~~\ror\r~~~\r <oy:X>\r~~~\rWhere X is the number of pixels to shift the event. Can be negative.\r\r### SmartDir\r\rBy default, when the player collides with an event it won't trigger the\rSmart Move Dir effect. To enable this, add following notetag to the event:\r~~~\r <smartDir>\r~~~\r\r### IgnoreCharas\r\rYou can have an event ignore certain characters when collision checking. This\rallows you to let some events move through some events or the player. Note that\rthis is not 2 ways, so if an event can move through the player, that doesn't\rmean the player can move through the event.\r~~~\r <ignoreCharas:CHARAIDS>\r~~~\rWhere CHARAIDS is a list of character Ids, separated by a comma\r\n\n## Map Notetags\r\r### GridSize\r\rYou can set the grid size for certain maps by using the notetag:\r~~~\r <grid:X>\r~~~\rWhere X is the grid size to use for this map.\r\r### OffGrid\r\rYou can set weither you can or can't move off the grid for certain maps by\rusing the notetag:\r~~~\r <offGrid:BOOL>\r~~~\rWhere BOOL is true or false\r\r### MidPass\r\rYou can set weither you want to use the mid pass function for certain maps by\rusing the notetag:\r~~~\r <midPass:BOOL>\r~~~\rWhere BOOL is true or false\r\n\n## Plugin Commands\r\r### Transfer\r\rMV event transfers are grid based. So this plugin command lets you map transfer\rto a pixel x / y position.\r~~~\r qMovement transfer [MAPID] [X] [Y] [OPTIONS]\r~~~\r- MAPID: The id of the map to transfer to\r- X: The x position to transfer to, in pixels\r- Y: The y position to transfer to, in pixels\r\rPossible options:\r\r- dirX: Set X to the dir to face after the transfer.\r  - Can be 2, 4, 6, 8, or for diagonals 1, 3, 7, 9\r- fadeBlack: Will fade black when transfering\r- fadeWhite: Will fade white when transfering\r\rExample:\r~~~\r qMovement transfer 1 100 116 dir2 fadeBlack\r~~~\rWill transfer the player to map 1 at x100, y116. There will be a black fade\rand player will be facing down\r~~~\r qMovement transfer 1 100 116\r~~~\rWill transfer the player to map 1 at x100, y116. There will be no fade and\rplayers direction won't change\r\r### Set Pos\r\rThis command will let you move a character to a x / y pixel position. Note\rthis will not \"walk\" the character to that position! This will place the\rcharacter at this position, similar to a transfer.\r~~~\r qMovement setPos [CHARAID] [X] [Y] [OPTIONS]\r~~~\r- CHARAID: The character identifier.\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID, eventEVENTID or this for the event that called this (replace EVENTID with a number)\r- X: The x position to set to, in pixels\r- Y: The y position to set to, in pixels\r\rPossible options:\r\r- dirX: Set X to the dir to face after the transfer.\r  - Can be 2, 4, 6, 8, or for diagonals 1, 3, 7, 9\r\r\r### Change Collider\r\rThis command will let you change a collider for a character. Note that you\rshould use this carefully. If you don't you can get that character stuck.\r~~~\r qMovement changeCollider [CHARAID] [TYPE] [SHAPE] [WIDTH] [HEIGHT] [OX] [OY]\r~~~\r- CHARAID: The character identifier.\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID, eventEVENTID or this for the event that called this (replace EVENTID with a number)\r- TYPE: The type of collider, set to default, collision or interaction\r- SHAPE: Set to box or circle\r- WIDTH: The width of the collider, in pixels\r- HEIGHT: The height of the collider, in pixels\r- OX: The X Offset of the collider, in pixels\r- OY: The Y Offset of the collider, in pixels\r\rYou can also set it to a preset by using the format:\r~~~\r qMovement changeCollider [CHARAID] [TYPE] preset [PRESETID]\r~~~\r- CHARAID: The character identifier.\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID, eventEVENTID or this for the event that called this (replace EVENTID with a number)\r- TYPE: The type of collider, set to default, collision or interaction\r- PRESETID: The PresetID you set in the preset parameter.\r\n\n## Tips\r\r### No closed open spaces!\r\rFor performance reasons, you should try to avoid having open spaces that are\rclosed off.\r\r![Example](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qmovement/openSpaces.png)\r\rOn the left we can see some tiles that have a collider border, but their inside\ris \"open\". This issue is should be corrected when using QPathfind because\rif someone was to click inside that \"open\" space, it is passable and QPathfind\rwill try to find a way in even though there is no way in and will cause massive\rlag. The fix can be pretty simple, you could add a CollisionMap (though that\rmay be another issue in its own) or add a RegionCollider to fill up the full\rtile like I did on the correct side of that image.\r\r### Collision Maps - Heavy\r\rTry to use collision maps only if you absolutely need to. Collision maps\rcan be very large images which will make your game use more memory and can\rcause some slower pcs to start lagging. The collision checking for collision\rmaps are also take about 2-4x more time to compute and is a lot less accurate\rsince it only checks if the colliders edge collided with the collision map.\rSo using collision maps, might be pretty, but use it with caution as it can\rslow down your game! A better solution for this would be to use a PolygonMap\rwhere you create polygon colliders and add them into the map.\r\n\n## Addons\r\r### Pathfind\r\rhttps://quxios.github.io/#/plugins/QPathfind\r\rQPathfind is an A* pathfinding algorithm. This algorithm can be pretty heavy\rif you are doing pixel based movements. So avoid having to many pathfinders\rrunning at the same time.\r\rFor the interval settings, you want to set this to a value where the path\rcan be found in 1-3 frames. You can think of intervals as the number of\rmoves to try per frame. The default setting 100, is good for grid based\rsince that will take you 100 grid spaces away. But for a pixel based, 100\rsteps might not be as far. If most of your pathfinds will be short (paths less then\r10 tiles away), then you should set this to a value between 100-300. For medium\rpaths (10-20 tiles away) try a value between 300-700. For large or complicated\rpaths (20+ tiles away or lots of obsticles) try something between 1000-2000.\rI would avoid going over 2000. My opinion is to keep it below 1000, and simplify\rany of your larger paths by either splitting it into multiple pathfinds or\rjust making the path less complex.\r\r\r### Collision Map\r\rhttps://quxios.github.io/#/plugins/QM+CollisionMap\r\rCollision Map is an addon for this plugin that lets you use images for\rcollisions. Note that collision map checks are a lot heavier then normal\rcollision checks. So this plugin can make your game laggier if used with\rother heavy plugins.\r\r\r### Region Colliders\r\rhttps://quxios.github.io/#/plugins/QM+RegionColliders\r\rRegion Colliders is an addon for this plugin that lets you add colliders\rto regions by creating a json file.\r\n\n## Showcase\r\rThis section is for user created stuff.

Using this plugin you can\rcreate more advance like action games.\r\r**_Note that the help section is still in development and may be missing\rsome info! Sorry!_**\r\rFor a demo visit the steamwork shop:\r\rhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=952886994\r","help":"\n## Is this for you?\r\rFirst, this is a very complex action battle system. If you're looking for\rsomething that you can spend less than an hour to set up then this plugin\ris not for you.\r\rTo make full use of this plugin you need to know how to properly use and\rsetup QMovement. If you don't know what that plugin is or what colliders\rare then again, this plugin is not for you.\r\rThere are a lot of actions for skill sequences so you can create some pretty\rcrazy skills. Learning how to use the actions may take awhile since there\rare a lot of actions, and maybe more to come.\r\rEnemies have a very basic AI. If you want to create more AI styles, you\rwill need to know how to JS and create a plugin / extend this plugin.\r\n\n## Skill Keys\r\r### Default Skill keys\r\rFor the player to be able to use a skill from a hotkey, you will first need\rto create a skill key in the plugin parameter `Default Skills`.\r\r![Skill Keys](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qabs/skillKeys.png)\r\rWhen creating a skill key you have 4 parameters:\r\r- #### Keyboard Input:\r * The keyboard input that will trigger this skill, set this to `mouse1` for\r   left click, and `mouse2` for right click.\r- #### Gamepad Input:\r * The gamepad input that will trigger this skill.\r- #### Rebind:\r * If this is true, the skill that's assigned to this skill key can be\r reassigned.\r- #### Skill Id:\r * The skill that this skill key will use when triggered.\r\r### _Note_ for input values those are the button values; `ok`, `cancel`, ect. Or\rif you're using an input plugin, use their value. For example in QInput you can\ruse the `#A` for the a key or `#tab` for tab, ect.\r\r### _Note_ that rebind doesn't do much as this doesn't have a rebinding feature.\rBut the ground work is there so it can easily be created for an addon.\r\r### _Note_ that the `Skill Key Number` is the number next to the skill key you created.\r`Skill Key Number` will be referenced later.\r\r![Skill Keys](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qabs/skillKeysNumber.png)\r\r\r### Class Skill keys\r\rYou can change the players skill keys based on their class by adding the notetag:\r~~~\r<skillKeys>\r[SKILL KEY NUMBER]: [SKILL ID] [REBIND?]\r</skillKeys>\r~~~\r- #### SKILL KEY NUMBER:\r * The skill key that you want to change\r- #### SKILL ID:\r * The skill to assign to this skill key number\r- #### REBIND?:\r * Set to true or false if this can be reassigned\r\rIf the skill key that you are trying to change has its `Rebind` value set to false,\rnothing will happen since it can't be reassigned.\r\r### _Important!_ make sure the skill key you are trying to set is created in the\rplugin parameters `Default Skills`. If it's not, the game will have an error.\r\rExample:\r~~~\r<skillKeys>\r1: 2\r3: 15\r4: 16\r</skillKeys>\r~~~\rClass Skill keys will replace the default skill keys. So if you set up skill\rkeys 1 through 9 in the parameters and a class changes the skills for skill\rkeys 1, 3, 4. The over all skill keys will be, 1, 3, 4 from the class and\rthe rest are from the default values.\r\r### Weapon Skill keys\r\rWeapons can also change the skill keys. For example you might want to change\rthe main attack to use a range skill if the player has a bow equipped! To do\rthis you use a similar tag as the class, but in the weapon\r~~~\r<skillKeys>\r[SKILL KEY NUMBER]: [SKILL ID]\r</skillKeys>\r~~~\r- #### SKILL KEY NUMBER:\r * The skill key that you want to change\r- #### SKILL ID:\r * The skill to assign to this skill key number\r\r### _Important!_ make sure the skill key you are trying to set is created in the\rplugin parameters `Default Skills`. If it's not, the game will have an error.\r\rExample:\r~~~\r<skillKeys>\r1: 3\r</skillKeys>\r~~~\rWeapon skill keys take top priority, so they will replace both class keys\rand the default keys! This example will replace skill key 1 with the skill\rid 3\r\r### Override Skill keys\r\rYou can manually override a skill key with a plugin command. Override skill keys\rtake priority over weapon, class and default skill keys.\r\rPlugin command:\r~~~\rqabs override SKILLKEYNUMBER SKILLID\r~~~\r- #### SKILLKEYNUMBER:\r * The skill key that you want to change\r- #### SKILLID:\r * The skill to assign to this skill key number. Set to -1 if you want to\r   remove this override\r\r### _Important!_ make sure the skill key you are trying to set is created in the\rplugin parameters `Default Skills`. If it's not, the game will have an error.\r\r### _Note_ that the player still needs to know the skill to be able to use it.\rAssigning it won't let him use it if he doesn't know it.\r\rExample:\r~~~\rqabs override 1 3\r~~~\rWill override skill key 1 and assign the skill with id 3. To remove this\roverride later on use the plugin command:\r~~~\rqabs override 1 -1\r~~~\r\n\n## Skills\r\r### Skill Settings\r\rEach skill should have a skill settings tag. This tag can change the settings\rfor the skills cooldown, through, and other effects. The tag is:\r~~~\r <absSettings>\r [SETTINGS]: [VALUE]\r </absSettings>\r~~~\rHere's a list of all the settings:\r~~~\rcollider: [SHAPE], [WIDTH], [HEIGHT]\rcollides: [STRING]\rcooldown: [NUMBER]\rinfront: [TRUE or FALSE]\rrotate: [TRUE or FALSE]\rthrough: [0, 1, 2 or 3]\rthroughTerrain: [LIST OF TERRAINS IT CAN GO THROUGH]\rgroundtarget: [NUMBER]\rselecttarget: [NUMBER]\r~~~\r- #### collider:\r * Set this to the collider this skill will use.

The format is:\r~~~\r<params>\rPARAM: VALUE\r</params>\r~~~\r- PARAM: The abbreviation of the parameter to modify. It can be:\r * MHP, MMP, ATK, DEF, MAT, MDF, AGI, LUK or any of the custom parameters you\r created\r- VALUE: Can be a number or a formula similar to skill formulas. With the formula \ryou can use, `a` and `v[X]` but not `b`! You can also use `current` and it'll\rreturn the current parameter value.\r\rYou can add as many params as you need, each param needs to be on their own line.\r\r### Rates\r\rYou can use this notetag to easily convert a X amount of points from a \rparameter to a % of an Ex or Sp Parameter.\r~~~\r<rates>\rX PARAM to XSPARAM\r</rates>\r~~~\r- X: A number, if negative it will have a negative gain in the rate\r- PARAM: The abbreviation of which parameter to use, can be:\r * MHP, MMP, ATK, DEF, MAT, MDF, AGI, LUK or any of the custom parameters you\r created\r- XSPARAM: The abbreviation of an Ex or Sp Parameter, can be:\r * hit, eva, cri, cev, mev, mrf, cnt, hrg, mrg, trg\r * tgr, grd, rec, pha, mcr, tcr, pdr, mdr, fdr, exr\r\r### RatesFormula\r\rSimilar to the <rates></rates> except you create the formula your self.\r~~~\r<ratsFormula>\rXSPARAM: VALUE\r</ratesFormula>\r~~~\r- XSPARAM: The abbreviation of an Ex or Sp Parameter, can be:\r * hit, eva, cri, cev, mev, mrf, cnt, hrg, mrg, trg\r * tgr, grd, rec, pha, mcr, tcr, pdr, mdr, fdr, exr\r- VALUE: Can be a number or a formula similar to skill formulas. With the formula\ryou can use, `a` and `v[X]` but not `b`! You can also use `current` and it'll\rreturn the current parameter value. Remember since it's a rate a return\rvalue of 1 is 100%, 0.5 is 50% and 0 is 0%\r\n\n## Examples\r\rHere's a few examples of the notetags\r\r### Params\r\r~~~\r<params>\rMHP: 100\rATK: 20\rHRT: 5\r</params>\r~~~\rThis would result in having 100 more hp, 20 more atk and an HRT of 5. HRT is\ra new built in parameter that works similar to hp regeneration except it's a\rfixed number.\r\r### Rates and RatesFormula\r\r~~~\r<rates>\r5 agi to cri\r5 agi to hit\r</rates>\r~~~\rThis would result in converting 5 agi to 1% of cri and hit. So if an actor has\r20agi, he would have a bonus 4% cri and hit because of this tag.\r\rTo achieve this using the <ratesFormula> it would be:\r~~~\r<ratesFormula>\rcri: (a.agi / 5) / 100\rhit: (a.agi / 5) / 100\r</ratesFormula>\r~~~\r\n\n## Links\r\rFormated Help:\r\r https://quxios.github.io/#/plugins/QParams\r\rRPGMakerWebs:\r\r http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/qplugins.73023/\r\rTerms of use:\r\r https://github.com/quxios/QMV-Master-Demo/blob/master/readme.md\r\rLike my plugins?

You can run a QEvent multiple times\rin a single frame compared to a common event which you can only run 1\rcommon event per frame (unless it's a parallel trigger).\r\rQEvents also pass in some extra info about where / who called the event. You\rcan grab that info with some script calls.\r\rTo make a common event as a QEvent, you need to add a comment with the following:\r~~~\r <QEvent>\r~~~\r\r### Extra into\r\rThe extra info is stored inside an Object which can be accessed with the\rscript call:\r~~~\r this.q\r~~~\r\rWhat is contained in the object depends on what calls it. By default they will\rall contain a `type` property which returns a string based on where it was\rcalled from.\r\n\n## Triggers\r\rI've added a few extra common event triggers:\r- move: Will run the common event when anything moves\r- eventMove: Will run the common event when any event moves\r- playerMove: Will run the common event when the player moves\r\rTo set the trigger you need to add a comment in the common event with the format:\r~~~\r<trigger:TYPE>\r~~~\rWhere TYPE can be; move, eventMove, or playerMove\r\rAll these common events will run as a QEvent even if they aren't maked as a\rQEvent.

Then you can use your\rsprites by identifying it as a QSprite. To do so, just name your sprite file\rby using the File Name Identifier format. By default this is:\r~~~\r %{config}-\r~~~\rYou would replace {config} with the config you made inside the QSprite\rEditor. For example, if I made a config named: `Hero` then I would name\rthe file something like: `%Hero-Example.png`\r\n\n## Built-in Poses\r\rThis plugin adds a few built in poses:\r- moveX\r- dashX\r- idleX\r- idle[A-Z]X ( more info for this below )\r- default\r\rWhere X is the direction:\r- 2: down\r- 4: left\r- 6: right\r- 8: up\r- 1: lower left\r- 3: lower right\r- 7: upper left\r- 9: upper right\r\r*(Diagonals only work if you are using this with QMovement)*\r\rDefault pose is used when and idleX or moveX is not found. Note that default\rdoes not have an X at the end, it's just default. Has no directions tied to\rit.\r\r\r### idle[A-Z]X\r\rThis is a random idle that will play a random `idle[A-Z]` every X frames.\rThe random wait depends on the `Random Idle Interval` parameter. To clarify\ryou won't be naming this pose `idle[A-Z]2` (for example for the down direction)\ryou would name it `idleA2` or `idleB2` or `idleC2`, ect.\r\rYou can also add in a multipier if you want one of the idles to appear more\roften then others by adding: `Tx` Where T is the multipler.\r\rFor example:\r\rLets say I want 4 `idle[A-Z]` poses, and I want one of them to have a 4 times\rbetter chance of appearing then the rest. My idle names would be:\r\r- idleA2\r- idleB2\r- idleC2\r- idleD4x2\r\r*Note: all their directions are 2(down)*\r\n\n## Notetags / Comments\r\r### Set default direction\r\rWith spritesheets being large, it may be hard to pick that events starting\rdirection. To fix that, you can add a comment in that event that will set\rit's default direction.\r~~~\r <direction:X>\r~~~\rSet X to direction. 2 for down, 4 left, 6 right, 8 up.\r\n\n## Plugin Commands\r\r### Playing a Pose\r\rPlay a pose.\r~~~\r qSprite [CHARAID] play [POSE] [list of options]\r~~~\r- CHARAID: The character identifier.\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID, eventEVENTID or this for the event that called this\r (replace EVENTID with a number)\r- POSE: The pose to play (Don’t add the direction! ex: atk, not atk2)\r\rPossible options:\r- lock: Disable character movement while pose is playing\r- pause: Pause the pose on the last frame\r- breakable: If character moves, the pose will end\r- wait: Next Event Command runs once pose is complete\r\r\r### Looping a Pose\r\rLoop a pose until it's cleared, broken out of or played over.\r~~~\r qSprite [CHARAID] loop [POSE] [list of options]\r~~~\r- CHARAID: The character identifier.\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID, eventEVENTID or this for the event that called this\r (replace EVENTID with a number)\r- POSE: The pose to play (Don’t add the direction! ex: atk, not atk2)\r\rPossible options:\r- lock: Disable character movement while pose is playing\r- breakable: If character moves, the loop will end\r- wait: Next Event Command runs once first loop has is complete\r\r### Clearing\r\rClear current playing/looping pose.\r~~~\r qSprite [CHARAID] clear\r~~~\r- CHARAID: The character identifier.\r - For player: 0, p, or player\r - For events: EVENTID, eEVENTID, eventEVENTID or this for the event that called this\r (replace EVENTID with a number)\r\r### Add / Remove an idle[A-Z]\r\rMaybe you only want to play an idle[A-Z] during certain scenes.
