    "about": "\n## About\r\rThis plugin completely rewrites the collision system to use colliders. Using\rcolliders enabled more accurate collision checking with dealing with pixel\rmovement. This plugin also lets you change how many pixels the characters\rmove per step, letting you set up a 24x24 movement or a 1x1 (pixel movement)\r\rNote there are a few mv features disabled/broken; mouse movement, followers,\rand vehicles.\r",
    "help": "\n## How to use\r\rTo setup a pixel based movement, you'll need to change the plugin parameters\rto something like:\r\r- Grid = 1\r- Off Grid = true\r- Mid Pass = false\r\rOther parameters can be set to your preference.\r\rFor a grid based movement, set it something like:\r\r- Grid = GRIDSIZE YOU WANT\r- Off Grid = false\r- Mid Pass = true\r\rWhen in grid based movement, you want your colliders to fill up most of the\rgrid size but with a padding of 4 pixels on all sides (this is because some\rtile colliders are 4 tiles wide or tall). So if your grid size was 48, your\rcolliders shouldn't be 48x48, instead they should be 40x40, with an ox and oy\rof 4. So your collider setting would look like: box, 40, 40, 4, 4\r\n\n## Colliders\r\rThere are 3 types of colliders; Polygon, Box and Circle. Though you can only\rcreate box and circle colliders, unless you modify the code to accept\rpolygons. This is intentional since polygon would be \"harder\" to setup.\r\r![Colliders Image](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qmovement/colliders.png)\r\r- Boxes takes in width, height, offset x and offset y\r- Circles similar to boxes, takes in width, height, offset x and offset y\r\r### Setting up colliders\r\rColliders are setup inside the Players notebox or as a comment inside an\rEvents page. Events colliders depends it's page, so you may need to make the\rcollider on all pages.\r\rThere are two ways to setup colliders. using `<collider:-,-,-,->` and using\r`<colliders>-</colliders>`. The first method sets the 'Default' collider for\rthat character. The second one you create the colliders for every collider\rtype.\r\r### Collider Types\r\rThere are 3 collider types. Default, Collision and Interaction.\r- Default: This is the collider to use if collider type that was called was\rnot found\r- Collision: This collider is used for collision checking\r- Interaction: This collider is used for checking interaction.\r\n\n## Collider Terms\r\r![Colliders Terms Image](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qmovement/colliderInfo.png)\r\r### Collider Notetag\r\r~~~\r<collider: shape, width, height, ox, oy>\r~~~\rThis notetag sets all collider types to these values.\r- Shape: Set to box or circle\r- Width: The width of the collider\r- Height: The height of the collider\r- OX: The x offset value of the collider\r- OY: The y offset value of the collider\r\r### Colliders Notetag\r\r~~~\r<colliders>\rtype: shape, width, height, ox, oy\r</colliders>\r~~~\rThis notetag sets all collider types to these values.\r- Type: The type of collider, set to default, collision or interaction\r- Shape: Set to box or circle\r- Width: The width of the collider\r- Height: The height of the collider\r- OX: The x offset value of the collider\r- OY: The y offset value of the collider\r\rTo add another type, just add `type: shape, width, height, ox, oy` on\ranother line.\r\rExample:\r~~~\r<colliders>\rdefault: box, 48, 48\rcollision: circle, 24, 24, 12, 12\rinteraction: box: 32, 32, 8, 8\r</colliders>\r~~~\r\n\n## Move Routes\r\rBy default, event move commands (moveup, movedown, ect) will convert to a\rqmove that moves the character based off your tilesize. So if your tilesize\ris 48 and your gridsize is 1. Then a moveup command will move the character\rup 48 pixels not 1. But if you want to move the character by a fixed amount\rof pixels, then you will use the QMove commands.\r\r### QMove\r\r![QMove Script Call](https://quxios.github.io/imgs/qmovement/qmove.png)\r\rTo do a QMove, add a script in the move route in the format:\r~~~\r qmove(DIR, AMOUNT, MULTIPLER)\r~~~\r- DIR: Set to a number representing the direction to move,\r 2: left, 4: right, 8: up 2: down,\r 1: lower left, 3: lower right, 7: upper left, 9: upper right,\r 5: current direction, 0: reverse direction\r- AMOUNT: The amount to move in that direction, in pixels\r- MULTIPLIER: multiplies against amount to make larger values easier [OPTIONAL]\r\rExample:\r~~~\r qmove(4, 24)\r~~~\rWill move that character 24 pixels to the left.\r\r### Arc\r\rArcing is used to make a character orbit around a position. Note that collisions\rare ignored when arcing, but interactions still work. To add a arc add a script\rin the move route in the format:\r~~~\r arc(PIVOTX, PIVOTY, RADIAN, CCWISE?, FRAMES)\r~~~\r- PIVOTX: The x position to orbit around, in pixels\r- PIVOTY: The y position to orbit around, in pixels\r- RADIAN: The degrees to move, in radians\r- CCWISE?: set to true or false; if true it will arc countclock wise\r- FRAMES: The amount of frames to complete the arc\r\rExample:\r~~~\r arc(480,480,Math.PI*2,false,60)\r~~~\rWill make the character do a full 360 arc clockwise around the point 480, 480\rand it'll take 60 frames.\r\n\n## Addons\r\r### Pathfind\r\rhttps://quxios.github.io/#/plugins/QPathfind\r\rQPathfind is an A* pathfinding algorithm. This algorithm can be pretty heavy\rif you are doing pixel based movements. So to help preform better it will\rstill try to calculate the path based on a grid, but this can lead to\rsome paths not being found even though it should since the character started\rin a middle of a tile. To fix this issue, you'll need to enable Half Opt.\rIt will increase the pathfinding accuracy but will also increase performance\rsince it makes the \"grid\" smaller, which means paths are now larger.\r\rFor the interval settings, you want to set this to a value where the path\rcan be found in 1-3 frames. You can think of intervals as the number of\rmoves to try per frame. The default setting 100, is good for grid based\rsince that will take you 100 grid spaces away. But for a pixel based, 100\rsteps isn't as far. If most of your pathfinds will be short (paths less then\r10 tiles away), then you should set this to a value between 100-300. For medium\rpaths (10-20 tiles away) try a value between 300-700. For large or complicated\rpaths (20+ tiles away or lots of obsticles) try something between 1000-2000.\rI would avoid going over 2000. My opinion is to keep it below 1000, and simplify\rany of your larger paths by either splitting it into multiple pathfinds or\rjust making the path less complex.\r\r\r### Collision Map\r\rTODO add link\r\rCollision Map is an addon for this plugin that lets you use images for\rcollisions. Note that collision map checks are a lot heavier then normal\rcollision checks. So this plugin can make your game laggier if used with\rother heavy plugins.\r\r\n\n## Links\r\rRPGMakerWebs:\r http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/qplugins.73023/\r\rTerms of use:\r https://github.com/quxios/QMV-Master-Demo/blob/master/readme.md\r\rLike my plugins?

    "help": "\n## How to use\r\rFirst configure your sprite with the Sprite Animator. Then you can use your\rsprites by identifying it as a QSprite. To do so, just name your sprite file\rby using the File Name Identifier format. By default this is:\r~~~\r  %{config}-\r~~~\rYou would replace {config} with the config you made inside the Sprite\rAnimator. For example, if I made a config named: `Hero` then I would name\rthe file something like: `%Hero-Example.png`\r\n\n## Built-in Poses\r\rThis plugin adds a few built in poses:\r - moveX\r - dashX\r - idleX\r - idle[A-Z]X ( more info for this below )\r - default\r\rWhere X is the direction:\r\r - 2 - down\r - 4 - left\r - 6 - right\r - 8 - up\r - 1 - lower left\r - 3 - lower right\r - 7 - upper left\r - 9 - upper right\r\r(Diagonals only work if you are using this with Quasi Movement)\r\rDefault pose is used when and idleX or moveX is not found. Note that default\rdoes not have an X at the end, it's just default. Has no directions tied to\rit.\r\r\r### idle[A-Z]X\r\rThis is a random idle that will play a random `idle[A-Z]` every X frames.\rThe random wait depends on the `Random Idle Interval` parameter. To clarify\ryou won't be naming this pose `idle[A-Z]2` (for example for the down direction)\ryou would name it `idleA2` or `idleB2` or `idleC2`, ect.\r\rYou can also add in a multipier if you want one of the idles to appear more\roften then others by adding: `Tx` Where T is the multipler.\r\rFor example:\r\rLets say I want 4 `idle[A-Z]` poses, and I want one of them to have a 4 times\rbetter chance of appearing then the rest. My idle names would be:\r\r  - idleA2\r  - idleB2\r  - idleC2\r  - idleD4x2\r\r(Note: all their directions are 2(down))\r\n\n## Notetags / Comments\r\r### Set default direction\r\rWith spritesheets being large, it may be hard to pick that events starting\rdirection.
